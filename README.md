# Where's that Pokemon?

This is an app to tie together all of the frontend and backend-as-a-service skills learned through [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) javascript curriculum

## The objective

Find all the characters presented to you and save your name (and score) on the global leaderboard.

## Features

* Timestamps on the server-side to track the player's score
* Global leaderboard with no login required
* One playable level

## Technologies used

* Cloud Firestore
* React

## Future work

If I were to revisit this project, I would spend some time adding a random level generator from a list of the possible characters shown in the image
